# Docker container for smbd to host a share for scanned files
# For Ubuntu 18.04
# smbd configuration is stored in the container's file system. No external mount for config info
# To build: sudo docker build --tag=smbd </path/to/Dockerfile> (Folder containing the Dockerfile should also contain any files to be used during the build)
# Note that dockerfile must be within the build context and literally named Dockerfile
# To run a container: sudo docker run -d --name samba -h scans -v /home/<user>/Docker/smbd/volumes/tmp:/tmp -p 445:445 --restart=unless-stopped smbd  
# To create a terminal to which to connect remove -d and replace with -it
# To connect to a running container with a terminal: sudo docker attach <container>
# To connect to a running container without a terminal: sudo docker exec -it <container> bash
# Samba needs to be able to write to /tmp to save scans. To allow "nobody" user to write set the permissions to 777 on the Docker hosts OS folder this is being mounted
